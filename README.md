## The Steel Fatigue Predictor

The Materials Genome Initiative is a government-funded project that aims to bring down the development cycle for new materials. The steel segment of it involves low alloy, spring alloy, and carburized steels.

Using machine learning, we can predict the fatigue strength of steel based on its chemical composition and processing information.
